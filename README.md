# Binance_P2P_Arbitrage
This Python Jupyter Notebook scrapes real-time data from Binance's P2P marketplace to identify USD arbitrage opportunities. Updating every minute, it provides current buy/sell prices, flags arbitrage chances, and offers additional data and charts for informed decision-making. Ideal for traders and data analysts, it's a one-stop tool.

Instructions:
1) Replace "Zinli" for the bank/platform you want to use. Be sure the name is the same as in the page source
2) Run the google colab and you will see if there is an arbitrage opportunity
